
Arduino-Tiny is an open source set of ATtiny "cores" for the Arduino platform. 

The Arduino platform currently supports Atmel ATmega processors. There is a need
for the Arduino platform to work with physically smaller DIP package processors.
The intent of this project is fulfill that need. Specifically, our goal is to
provide a core that enables Arduino users to work with the ATtiny 84 (44/24),
ATtiny 85 (45/25), and ATtiny 2313 processors.

INSTALLATION

First ensure the Arduino software is correctly installed.

Next...

* Ensure the Arduino IDE is NOT running.

* Download the Arduino-Tiny archive (ZIP-file).

* Locate the Arduino Sketch folder.  This is the folder where the Arduino IDE
  stores Sketches.

* Ensure the "hardware" folder exists under the Arduino Sketch folder.  For
  example, if the Arduino Sketch folder is...

      C:\Projects\Arduino\

  Ensure this folder exists...

      C:\Projects\Arduino\hardware\
      
* Extract the contents of the archive into the "hardware" folder.  For example,
  if the Arduino Sketch folder is...

      C:\Projects\Arduino

  After extracting, the following two files should exist...

      C:\Projects\Arduino\hardware\tiny\boards.txt
      C:\Projects\Arduino\hardware\tiny\bootloaders\attiny84\empty.hex

  And the following folder should contain the Arduino-Tiny core...

      C:\Projects\Arduino\hardware\tiny\cores\tiny\

* Open the "boards.txt" file and change both of the "upload.using" entries to
  the appropriate value for your setup.  Following from the examples above, the
  file would be here...

      C:\Projects\Arduino\hardware\tiny\boards.txt

* Start the Arduino IDE and ensure there are two new boards listed under the 
  [Tools] [Board] menu...

      "ATtiny84 @ 8 MHz"
      "ATtiny84 @ 1 MHz"

You are now ready to use Arduino-Tiny!
